/**
 * The permission picker's render budget, measured through the form that ships.
 *
 * Each group offers three levels, so the picker is three toggles a group. It
 * used to hold one flat `Scope[]` for all of them, which made every click a
 * re-render of the whole thing; each row takes its own
 * field off the form now, so a click costs the three toggles of one row.
 *
 * `CreateTokenForm` is mounted rather than the picker on a bare `useForm`,
 * because the wrapper is where this gets lost: a `Controller` on `permissions`
 * subscribes to the object the rows write, so it would re-render the picker on
 * every click and the three-toggle budget would be true only of a test double.
 *
 * Runs in the `render-budget` project, which does not enable the React
 * Compiler — deliberately. The compiler brought the old shape down to zero on
 * its own, which is exactly why nobody noticed.
