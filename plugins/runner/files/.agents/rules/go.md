# Go Service Rules

`apps/runner` is the Go template for services the NestJS API delegates to,
and `packages/go/*` is the shared toolkit it is built from — the Go
counterpart of `packages/backend/*`. It is the same hexagon as `apps/api`,
written the way the Go community writes services — not a port of NestJS
idioms.

## Modules and the workspace

- Every directory under `packages/go/` is its own Go module
  (`github.com/jordiparracrespo/flama-ai/packages/go/<name>`), listed in the
  root `go.work`. Each module's `go.mod` carries a `require` **and** a
  relative `replace` for every sibling it imports, transitively — `go mod
  tidy` ignores `go.work`, and the Docker build must work without it.
- A shared module never imports an app. Anything a second service could use
  goes to `packages/go`; anything that names jobs, keys or this service's
  scopes stays in the app.
- Each module has a `package.json` (`@flama/go-<name>`) that declares the
  sibling modules it imports as `workspace:*` devDependencies. That
  declaration is the Turborepo graph: without it `--affected` does not see
  the edge, and the runner's image is not rebuilt when a module it imports
  changes. It carries no `build`, `lint` or `test` script — the Node
  pipeline never needs Go; `go` and the Makefiles do that work. New module
  ⇒ `go.work`, `package.json`, `pnpm install`.
- The repo root is not a module: use
  `go test github.com/jordiparracrespo/flama-ai/...` or
  `make -C packages/go <target>`, never `./...` from the root.

## Layout and boundaries

- `cmd/<binary>/main.go` only parses signals, loads config, builds the logger
  and calls `server.New`. No wiring lives in `main`.
- `internal/server` is the **composition root**: the only package that names
  concrete adapters. A context's `module.go` may pick its own defaults.
- Whatever `server.New` opens — a pool, a listener, a worker pool — registers
  its cleanup on the server's `core/lifecycle` stack the moment it exists.
  A failing `New` closes the stack to unwind what it opened; `Shutdown` is
  closing it, last opened first. Never close a resource by hand in an error
  branch, and give every cleanup a deadline it can be abandoned at.
- A bounded context is `internal/<name>/{domain,app,adapters/*,module.go}`.
  `domain` imports nothing but `core/problem`, `auth/scope` and the app's
  `scopes`; `app` adds `auth` and `core`; adapters import their own context
  and any `packages/go` module. `internal/arch/arch_test.go` fails the build
  on anything else — add every new context to its `contexts` list.
- `packages/go/*` is domain-agnostic. If a shared module needs to know about
  jobs or keys, invert it: declare an interface or callback (`ws.Authorizer`,
  `auth.Verifier`) and let the context supply it.

## Dependency injection

- Constructors take an `Options` struct; nothing reads globals or `os.Getenv`
  outside `internal/config`.
- Ports are interfaces declared **next to the use case** (`app/ports.go`),
  not next to the adapter. Adapters assert conformance:
  `var _ app.Repository = (*Repository)(nil)`.
- A nil optional dependency is a nil interface, never a typed nil pointer
  wrapped in one (see `internal/server` around the JWT issuer).

## Errors

- Handlers are `httpx.HandlerFunc` and **return** errors; they never write
  error bodies. The router renders `*problem.Error` as `application/problem+json`
  and everything else as an opaque 500 logged with the correlation id.
- Catalog entries are package-level `problem.New("<CTX>_00n", status, title)`
  values in `<ctx>/domain/errors.go`. `title` is stable; per-request text goes
  through `WithDetail`. Every code gets a row under "Runner service" in
  `apps/docs/docs/errors.md`.
- Domain methods return sentinel `errors.New` values or typed errors; the
  **use case** maps them to problems. The domain never imports HTTP.
- Wrap with `%w`, compare with `errors.Is`/`errors.As`. `golangci-lint`'s
  `errorlint` enforces it.

## Authentication and scopes

- Every route under `/v1` sits behind `auth.Authenticate`; scope checks are
  `auth.RequireScopes` on a router group, never inline `if` checks.
- New resources get scopes in the app's `internal/scopes` catalog
  (`resource:read|write`; `write` implies `read`); the grammar and `Set`
  live in `packages/go/auth/scope` and are never redefined per service. Keys and tokens can only carry scopes their minter
  holds — keep that check in the use case.
- Secrets are compared with `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, stored as
  SHA-256 (they are 256-bit random, not passwords), and never logged. A
  verifier reports one `ErrInvalidCredential`; the reason is for the log.

## HTTP and WebSocket

- Standard `net/http` mux with `METHOD /path/{param}` patterns. No framework;
  `chi` is the only acceptable addition if groups outgrow `httpx.Router`.
- Never set a global write timeout on the server — it kills WebSockets. Bound
  headers (`ReadHeaderTimeout`) and bodies (`httpx.MaxBytes`) instead.
- A request's context is not the signal context. On SIGTERM `httpx.Serve`
  stops accepting, lets in-flight requests finish within
  `RUNNER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, then runs the shutdown hooks (sockets get
  `1001`, workers are waited on, pools close); only a request still running
  when the budget is spent sees its context cancelled.
- `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof/` live on the optional admin listener
  (`RUNNER_ADMIN_ADDR`, `httpx.AdminHandler`), never on the public router.
  It is unauthenticated: loopback or a private interface, never published.
  A new gauge or counter is a function registered on the server's
  `core/metrics` registry over a number something already keeps; there is
  no Prometheus client.
- One goroutine writes to a socket. Publishers enqueue on a bounded channel
  and a full channel closes the client (`ws/conn.go`); never block a publisher
  on a slow consumer.
- Long-lived work takes a `context.Context` and stops when it is cancelled;
  `Cancel` on a job is a context cancellation, not a flag the runner polls.
  Waiting for that work takes a context too: a runner that ignores
  cancellation is abandoned at the shutdown deadline and logged, never
  waited on forever.

## Config and environment

- The root `.env` is the only env file. `internal/config` loads it outside
  production and never overwrites a real variable. Every new variable gets a
  note in the root `.env.example` under "Runner (apps/runner)".
- Required secrets fail `config.Parse` with every problem listed at once.
  Optional capabilities are nil pointers (`cfg.JWT == nil`), reported by
  `/health/capabilities`, never sentinel strings.

## Tooling

- `make -C packages/go build vet lint test test-race` (golangci-lint, config
  in the root `.golangci.yml`) is what `.github/workflows/runner.yml` runs
  across the workspace: build, vet, lint and test on `gha-vm`, the race
  detector in its own job on GitHub's hosted image (which has the C compiler
  cgo needs), and `govulncheck` over every module. All of them must be clean
  before a push; run `make test-race` locally for anything concurrent.
- Code that parses outside input — a header, a frame, a file, a scope — has
  a native fuzz target (`func FuzzX(f *testing.F)` in a `*_fuzz_test.go`)
  with a seed corpus of real and hostile cases, and checks a property beyond
  "does not panic" (round trips, what may be accepted). `go test` runs the
  seeds; run the fuzzer itself with
  `go test -run='^$' -fuzz='^FuzzX$' -fuzztime=30s ./path`. A crasher it
  writes to `testdata/fuzz/` is committed with the fix, as a regression seed.
- The Go version is the `toolchain` line in the root `go.work` (CI's
  setup-go installs exactly that, and `govulncheck` scans its standard
  library); every module's `go.mod` carries the same `go` and `toolchain`
  lines, and `apps/runner/Dockerfile` builds on the same minor
  (`golang:<minor>-alpine`). A bump changes all three together. Stay on a
  supported release: `govulncheck` fails on standard-library fixes that
  only ship in newer Go.
- Add a dependency only when the standard library cannot do the job, and pin
  it in `go.mod` with `go mod tidy`.
- Tests use `httptest` end to end (`internal/server/server_test.go`) and the
  in-memory adapters; nothing in `go test` needs Docker.
