# packages/go — shared Go modules

The Go counterpart of `packages/backend/*`: reusable modules every Go
service in the monorepo builds on, each an interface plus implementations
plus a constructor the service selects by config. One `go.work` at the repo
root ties them together; each module also carries relative `replace`
directives so it stays buildable and tidy-able on its own.

| Module       | npm name           | Purpose                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`       | `@flama/go-core`   | `problem`: RFC 7807 documents mirroring the API's; `logging`: slog setup; `lifecycle`: the cleanup stack; `metrics`: Prometheus text exposition |
| `config`     | `@flama/go-config` | Root `.env` loader mirroring `@flama/env`; typed accessors that collect errors   |
| `httpx`      | `@flama/go-httpx`  | `net/http` router with middleware groups, error-returning handlers, JSON, server with a graceful drain, admin routes (`/metrics`, pprof) |
| `health`     | `@flama/go-health` | `/healthz`, `/readyz` with registered checkers, `/health/capabilities`           |
| `auth`       | `@flama/go-auth`   | Bearer middleware, `Principal`, scope grammar and guard, HS256 service tokens    |
| `ws`         | `@flama/go-ws`     | WebSocket hub: topics, backpressure, keepalive, graceful going-away              |
| `postgres`   | `@flama/go-postgres` | Pooled `pgx` connection, forward-only SQL migrator (advisory-locked), readiness checker |

Dependency flow: `core` ← `httpx` ← `health`, `auth` ← `ws`; `config` and
`postgres` stand alone. `core` imports only the standard library, its
`lifecycle` and `metrics` packages included. A module never imports an app.

## How Turborepo sees them

Every module has a `package.json` naming it `@flama/go-<module>` and
declaring the modules it imports as `workspace:*` devDependencies. That
declaration is what gives Turborepo the graph: `apps/runner` lists all
seven, so `--affected` counts the runner as changed when a module it
imports changes, which is what rebuilds its image. The only scripts are
`clean` and the runner's `dev`: no `build`, `lint` or `test`, so the Node pipeline (`pnpm build`,
`pnpm test`, the Check job) never needs a Go toolchain. Go is built, vetted,
linted and tested by `go` itself, through the Makefile below locally and
`.github/workflows/runner.yml` in CI.

## Commands

```bash
make -C packages/go build vet lint test   # whole workspace, from go.work
make -C packages/go test-race             # the same tests under the race detector (needs a C compiler)
make -C packages/go tidy                  # go mod tidy for every module
```

The repo root is not a module, so `./...` does not resolve there. Use the
module-path pattern (`go test github.com/jordiparracrespo/flama-ai/...`) or
the Makefile, which derives directory patterns from `go list -m`.

## Adding a module

1. `packages/go/<name>/go.mod` with the module path
   `github.com/jordiparracrespo/flama-ai/packages/go/<name>`, plus a
   `require` and a relative `replace` for every sibling it imports, transitively.
2. Add it to `use (...)` in the root `go.work`.
3. `package.json` named `@flama/go-<name>` with the sibling modules as
   `workspace:*` devDependencies; copy a sibling's.
4. `pnpm install` to refresh the lockfile.
5. Consumers add the module to their `go.mod` (require + replace) and to
   their `package.json` devDependencies. `apps/runner/internal/arch` decides
   which layers of a service may import it.

Rules for the code itself are in `.agents/rules/go.md`.

## Go services

The product backend is NestJS and stays that way. Go enters for the one
service where Node is the wrong tool: a static binary with no runtime, tens
of thousands of long-lived connections, or orchestrating processes, VMs and
containers on a host. `apps/runner` is the template for that service, with a
working example workload so every layer is exercised before you replace it.

The consumer apps never talk to it. The NestJS API does, with an API key, and
the agents it manages talk back with short-lived service tokens.

### Same hexagon, idiomatic Go

The layer model mirrors `apps/api`; the machinery does not. Go has no
decorators and needs no DI container, so the same boundaries are expressed
with interfaces, constructors and package visibility:

| Concern              | NestJS (`apps/api`)                  | Go (`apps/runner`)                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Module               | `@Module` + providers                | `internal/<ctx>/module.go` with `Options` and `New`  |
| Port                 | Abstract class + DI token            | Interface in `app/ports.go`                          |
| Adapter              | `@Injectable` bound to the token     | Struct asserting `var _ app.Port = (*Adapter)(nil)`  |
| Wiring               | Nest resolves the graph              | `internal/server` calls every constructor            |
| Errors               | `AppError` + `AllExceptionsFilter`   | `*problem.Error` returned from handlers              |
| Guards               | `@UseGuards`, `@CheckPolicies`       | `auth.Authenticate`, `auth.RequireScopes` on groups  |
| Boundary enforcement | dependency-cruiser                   | `internal/arch/arch_test.go`                         |

### Shared modules, the Go `packages/backend`

Everything domain-agnostic lives in `packages/go/*`, one Go module per
concern, tied together by a `go.work` at the repo root:

| Module   | Turborepo name     | Provides                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`   | `@flama/go-core`   | RFC 7807 documents, slog setup, cleanup stack, metrics     |
| `config` | `@flama/go-config` | Root `.env` loader, typed accessors that collect errors    |
| `httpx`  | `@flama/go-httpx`  | Router with middleware groups, JSON helpers, server, admin routes |
| `auth`   | `@flama/go-auth`   | Bearer middleware, `Principal`, scope grammar, JWT         |
| `health` | `@flama/go-health` | Liveness, readiness, capabilities                          |
| `ws`     | `@flama/go-ws`     | WebSocket hub with backpressure and keepalive              |
| `postgres` | `@flama/go-postgres` | Pooled pgx connection, advisory-locked SQL migrator, readiness checker |

Each module has a `package.json` that declares the sibling modules it
imports as workspace dependencies. That is what lets Turborepo's
`--affected` see the edges: a change in `core` marks everything above it,
the runner's image included. Every module also carries relative `replace`
directives so it builds and tidies on its own, which is what the Docker
build relies on.

### What the template ships

- **Config** from the root `.env` outside production, real env vars winning,
  the bootstrap key required, service tokens optional and reported on
  `/health/capabilities`.
- **Errors** as the same RFC 7807 documents the API produces (from
  `packages/go/core/problem`). Each module owns its codes in its own
  `domain/errors.go` — `apps/runner/internal/jobs/domain/errors.go` and
  `apps/runner/internal/apikeys/domain/errors.go` are the `JOB_*` and
  `APIKEY_*` catalogs.
- **Authentication** by API key (`flr_…`, SHA-256 at rest, revocable,
  scoped) or HS256 service token, both resolving to one `Principal`.
- **Scopes** in the `resource:read|write` vocabulary of the
  [permission catalog](../shared/src/scopes/README.md): `jobs`, `keys`, `events`.
- **REST** on the standard library router with request ids, panic recovery,
  structured access logs, body limits and a trusted-proxy setting.
- **WebSocket** hub with topic subscriptions, per-connection backpressure,
  ping keepalive and a `1001 Going Away` on shutdown.
- **Shutdown** that drains: in-flight requests finish within the budget,
  then a cleanup stack (`core/lifecycle`) closes sockets, workers and the
  pool in reverse order of opening, abandoning at the deadline whatever
  ignores it. The same stack unwinds a boot that fails half-way.
- **Operations**: an optional internal listener (`RUNNER_ADMIN_ADDR`) with
  Prometheus `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof/`, and a binary that is its own
  healthcheck (`runner healthcheck`, `runner version`) for the distroless
  image.
- **Fuzz targets** on every parser of outside input: scopes, the bearer
  header and service tokens, WebSocket frames, `.env` lines, API keys.
- **Jobs** as the example context: submit, list, cancel over REST; every
  transition pushed over the socket; a worker pool with cancellation.

### Choosing libraries

The standard library is the framework. Since Go 1.22 `net/http` routes by
method and path parameter, which removed the reason to reach for Gin, Echo,
Fiber or Gorilla's mux. The template adds exactly three dependencies:
`coder/websocket`, `golang-jwt` and `pgx` for the optional Postgres stores.
Reach for `chi` only if you need route groups the stdlib mux cannot
express. Metrics are the Prometheus text format written by hand over
functions the service registers (`core/metrics`); bring in
`prometheus/client_golang` when you need histograms, not before.

### Running and building

```bash
pnpm --filter @flama/runner dev                 # reads the root .env
make -C packages/go test                        # every Go module in go.work
docker build -f apps/runner/Dockerfile .        # distroless, non-root, ~10 MB
```

CI builds, vets, lints and tests the whole workspace in its own workflow,
`.github/workflows/runner.yml`, which also runs the race detector (on
GitHub's hosted image: it needs a C compiler the `gha-vm` runners lack) and
`govulncheck` over every module; the image is built with the others,
because `apps/runner` has a Dockerfile. See
`apps/runner/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the "add a bounded context" cookbook.
