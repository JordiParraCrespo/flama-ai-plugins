# @flama/go-ws — Agent Instructions

> Read the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) first, then
> [`packages/go/README.md`](../README.md) for how the Go modules fit
> together and [`apps/runner/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../../apps/runner/ARCHITECTURE.md)
> for the hexagon they serve.

## Where things go

- Who may subscribe is the module's `Authorizer`; the hub does not know about scopes.
- A new event shape is a payload type in the publishing module; the `Envelope` does not change.
- Anything a second service would copy belongs here; anything one service
  owns stays in that service under `internal/`.

## Before pushing

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...   # this module
go test -count=1 ./...    # this module
make -C .. test           # every module in go.work, the runner's boundary test included
```

## Patterns agents get wrong

- Importing another module's internals instead of its exported type. The
  modules depend on each other only through what they export: `core` under
  everything, `auth` on `core` and `httpx`, `ws` on `auth`.
- Hand-writing a JSON error body. Every failure is an RFC 7807 problem
  document from `core/problem`, rendered by the `httpx` router.
- Reaching for a framework. Standard `net/http`, `slog`, interfaces as
  ports and constructor injection are the whole toolkit.
