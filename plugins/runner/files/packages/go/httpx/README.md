# @flama/go-httpx

The HTTP toolkit every Go adapter builds on: a router over the standard
library mux with middleware groups, a handler type that returns errors, JSON
helpers, the cross-cutting middleware chain and the server lifecycle. It stays
on `net/http` on purpose. Go 1.22 gave the mux method matching and path
parameters, so handlers remain plain `http.Handler`s testable with `httptest`
and compatible with any third-party middleware.

## What it exports

`router.go`

- `HandlerFunc` — `func(w, r) error`; the router renders the error as a
  problem document, so handlers never write error bodies.
- `Router`: `NewRouter(problems)`, `Use`, `Group`, `Handle`, `HandleFunc`,
  `Wrap`, `ServeHTTP`. Unmatched routes come back as 404/405 problems through
  the root middleware stack, not as the mux's plain text.
- `Middleware` and `Chain(h, mw...)` (first listed runs outermost).

`middleware.go`

- `RequestID()` (reads and echoes `RequestIDHeader`, `X-Request-Id`),
  `Recover(problems, logger)`, `Logger(logger)` (one access-log line per
  request), `MaxBytes(limit)`, `RealIP(hops)`, `SecurityHeaders()`,
  `ClientIP(r)`.

`json.go`

- `DecodeJSON(r, v)` rejects unknown fields, trailing data and oversized
  bodies with the right problem; `WriteJSON(w, status, v)`; `NoContent(w)`.

`server.go`

- `ServerOptions` and `Serve(ctx, logger, opts, handler, onShutdown...)`:
  listens (on `Addr`, or on `Listener` when one is handed over) until the
  context is cancelled, then shuts down within one `ShutdownTimeout`
  budget. Request contexts are not derived from the signal context, so
  in-flight requests finish during the drain instead of failing on
  SIGTERM; hijacked connections (WebSockets) keep streaming. After the
  drain the hooks run with what is left of the budget — close sockets,
  wait for workers, release pools — so nothing a request still holds is
  closed under it. A request still running when the budget is spent has
  its context cancelled and its connection closed. No global write
  timeout, so WebSockets survive.

`admin.go`

- `AdminHandler(metrics)`: the routes of an internal listener, apart from
  the public router — `GET /metrics` (the handler passed in, normally a
  `metrics.Registry`) and `net/http/pprof` under `/debug/pprof/`.
  Unauthenticated by design: bind it to loopback or a private interface.

## How to use it

The composition root in `apps/runner/internal/server/server.go`:

```go
root := httpx.NewRouter(problems)
root.Use(
	httpx.RealIP(cfg.TrustProxy),
	httpx.RequestID(),
	httpx.Recover(problems, logger),
	httpx.Logger(logger),
	httpx.SecurityHeaders(),
	httpx.MaxBytes(cfg.MaxBodyBytes),
)
root.Group(func(api *httpx.Router) {
	api.Use(auth.Authenticate(problems, logger, verifiers...))
	jobsModule.Mount(api)
})
```

A handler in `apps/runner/internal/jobs/adapters/http` decodes, calls the
use case and returns whatever fails:

```go
func (h *Handler) submit(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error {
	var in submitRequest
	if err := httpx.DecodeJSON(r, &in); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	// …
	return httpx.WriteJSON(w, http.StatusAccepted, body)
}
```

## How to run it

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
go build ./...
```

## Dependencies

Imports `@flama/go-core` (`core/problem`). Imported by `@flama/go-health` and
`@flama/go-auth` (`@flama/go-ws` pulls it in only transitively, through
`auth`), and in `apps/runner` by every HTTP adapter, the composition root and
`cmd/server/main.go` (`httpx.Serve`).
